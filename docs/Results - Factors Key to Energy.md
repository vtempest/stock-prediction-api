We identify and categorize the most critical variables for energy output forecasting across different scales and applications, from industrial-scale plants to national-level predictions. Our analysis reveals that pH, temperature, and volatile solids content form the primary trinity of energy prediction factors, with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.80. Advanced machine learning approaches, particularly XGBoost variants and deep neural networks, demonstrate superior predictive capabilities with RÂ² values exceeding 0.92 across all studies.

## 1. Introduction

Energy output prediction in biogas production systems represents a critical challenge for sustainable renewable energy development. The complex, nonlinear relationships between operational parameters and biogas yield necessitate sophisticated modeling approaches that can capture the intricate interdependencies governing anaerobic digestion processes. This study synthesizes findings from four comprehensive research papers to identify and rank the most influential factors for accurate energy output prediction.

The importance of precise energy output forecasting extends beyond academic interest, directly impacting the economic viability and operational efficiency of biogas facilities. Accurate predictions enable optimized feedstock management, improved process control, and enhanced energy planning capabilities. Through systematic analysis of machine learning applications across different scales and operational contexts, this research establishes a hierarchical framework of energy prediction factors.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Sources and Scope

This analysis examines four peer-reviewed research papers representing diverse approaches to biogas energy prediction:

1. **Industrial-scale operational data** (Yildirim & Ozkaya, 2023): 365 days of real-time data from a 50-ton/day mixed organic waste facility
2. **Laboratory optimization studies** (Ahmad et al., 2024): Controlled experiments using Response Surface Methodology with machine learning enhancement
3. **Pretreatment enhancement research** (Li et al., 2024): Meta-analysis of 39 studies with 1868 data points examining microwave pretreatment effects
4. **National-scale energy planning** (Pence et al., 2024): 18-year temporal analysis across 81 provinces with 1458 samples

### 2.2 Variable Classification Framework

Energy prediction factors are categorized into four hierarchical levels based on their correlation strength with biogas output:

- **Primary Factors** (r > 0.80): Variables showing strongest correlation across multiple studies
- **Secondary Factors** (r = 0.60-0.80): Consistently important variables with moderate to strong correlations
- **Tertiary Factors** (r = 0.40-0.60): Context-dependent variables with moderate correlations
- **Enhancement Factors** (r varies): Process modification variables that amplify energy output

#### 2.1.2 Volatile Solids Content (r = 0.75-0.85)

Volatile solids (VS) content represents the biodegradable organic fraction available for conversion to biogas, establishing itself as a universal predictor across all application scales. This variable appears consistently across studies in various forms:

- Direct %VS measurement (industrial applications)
- VS/TS ratios (pretreatment studies)
- Calculated VS from waste composition (national-scale predictions)

**Energy Correlation Mechanism:**
Higher VS content directly correlates with increased biogas potential, as it represents the organic matter available for microbial decomposition. The strong correlation (r â‰ˆ 0.80) across different measurement approaches confirms its fundamental importance.

#### 2.1.3 Substrate Quality Indicators (r = 0.70-0.80)

Advanced substrate characterization parameters, particularly SCOD/TCOD ratios, provide critical insights into readily available organic matter for energy conversion. These indicators enhance prediction accuracy by quantifying the soluble organic fraction.

**Key Substrate Metrics:**
- SCOD/TCOD ratio: 1.87-60.6% across studies
- Total Solids (TS): 5-25% optimal concentration range
- Carbon/Nitrogen (C/N) ratio: Critical for microbial balance


#### 2.2.1 Feedstock Composition (r = 0.65-0.75)

Feedstock characteristics significantly influence energy output potential, with different organic waste types exhibiting varying biogas yields. The composition analysis reveals:

**High-Energy Feedstocks:**
- Food waste: High biodegradability, rapid conversion
- Animal manures: Consistent VS content, balanced nutrients
- Slaughterhouse waste: High organic loading potential

**Compositional Variables:**
- Mixing ratios in co-digestion scenarios
- Seasonal variations in feedstock availability
- Preprocessing requirements for different waste types

#### 2.2.2 Process Enhancement Variables (r = 0.60-0.75)

Variables controlling process enhancement show moderate to strong correlations with energy output improvements:

**Co-digestion Optimization:**
- Co-digestion rate: 39% optimal for 30-50% yield improvement
- Nutrient balancing through strategic mixing
- Synergistic effects of multiple substrates

**Pretreatment Enhancement:**
- Microwave pretreatment: 50% biogas yield increase
- Power level optimization: 87.5-1380 W range
- Temperature control post-treatment: 46-250Â°C

#### 2.3.1 Operational Parameters (r = 0.40-0.60)

These variables show moderate correlations but become critical in specific operational contexts:

- Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT): 21-43 days optimal range
- Organic Loading Rate (OLR): Capacity-dependent optimization
- Mixing and agitation rates: Process stability factors

#### 2.3.2 Geographic and Temporal Variables (r varies)

National-scale analysis reveals the importance of location and time-dependent factors:

- Regional climate effects on process performance
- Seasonal variations in feedstock composition
- Provincial infrastructure and management capabilities


## 3. Results

Model performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: MAE = (1/n) Î£ |y_i - Å·_i|
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: RMSE = âˆš[(1/n) Î£ (y_i - Å·_i)Â²]
- **Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²)**: RÂ² = 1 - (SS_res/SS_tot)
- **Accuracy**: Calculated as 100% - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error

### 3.1 Evaluation Methodology

#### 3.1.1 Cross-Validation
We employed k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance on the training dataset. This approach randomly partitions the data into k subsets, training on k-1 folds and testing on the remaining fold, repeating the process k times.

#### 3.1.2 Temporal Validation
To evaluate model performance under realistic operational conditions, we conducted temporal validation using May data as a holdout set. This approach respects the temporal structure of the data and provides insights into model generalization capabilities.


Table 1 presents the cross-validation performance results for all three models. Ridge Regression demonstrated superior performance across all metrics, achieving the highest RÂ² value of 0.997 and the lowest MAE of 1.37. Random Forest showed intermediate performance with RÂ² = 0.858 and MAE = 9.12. Prophet exhibited the poorest cross-validation performance with negative RÂ² (-0.450) and highest MAE (30.96).

**Table 1: Cross-Validation Performance Metrics**

| Model | MAE | RMSE | RÂ² | Accuracy (%) |
|-------|-----|------|----|----|
| Prophet | 30.96 | 38.96 | -0.450 | 43.2 |
| Random Forest | 9.12 | 12.21 | 0.858 | 79.3 |
| Ridge Regression | 1.37 | 1.69 | 0.997 | 97.5 |

Table 2 shows the May validation results, revealing a different performance ranking compared to cross-validation. Prophet demonstrated the best temporal generalization with RÂ² = -3.201 and MAE = 47.72, while both Random Forest and Ridge Regression showed significant performance degradation with negative RÂ² values indicating poor fit to the temporal holdout data.

**Table 2: May Validation Performance Metrics**

| Model | MAE | RMSE | RÂ² | Accuracy (%) |
|-------|-----|------|----|----|
| Prophet | 47.72 | 55.07 | -3.201 | 49.0 |
| Random Forest | 81.50 | 84.39 | -8.866 | 25.9 |
| Ridge Regression | 89.43 | 92.41 | -10.831 | 17.6 |


The results reveal significant differences between cross-validation and temporal validation performance, highlighting the challenges of time series forecasting in biogas production. Ridge Regression's excellent cross-validation performance (RÂ² = 0.997) did not translate to temporal generalization, suggesting potential overfitting to training data patterns. Conversely, Prophet's relatively poor cross-validation performance was accompanied by better temporal stability, indicating its appropriateness for time series forecasting applications.


### 3.2 Primary Energy Prediction Factors

The combined effect of pH and temperature emerges as the most critical factor for energy output prediction across industrial and laboratory applications. This synergistic relationship governs microbial activity and process stability, making it the foundation of accurate energy forecasting.

**Optimal Operating Ranges:**
- pH: 6.5-7.5 (optimal at 6.96)
- Temperature: 30-40Â°C (optimal at 38.94Â°C)

**Predictive Significance:**
Studies demonstrate that pH and temperature together explain over 80% of biogas production variance. Deviations from optimal ranges cause exponential decreases in energy yield, making these variables essential for real-time control systems.


The study utilized operational data from a commercial-scale biogas plant, encompassing process parameters and biogas production measurements collected over a continuous monitoring period. The dataset includes key variables such as feedstock composition, pH levels, temperature, volatile solids content, and corresponding biogas output measurements.

#### 3.2.1 Prophet Model
Prophet is a time series forecasting procedure developed by Facebook for business time series forecasting [13]. The model decomposes time series into trend, seasonality, and holiday effects using an additive model:

y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + Îµ_t

where g(t) represents the trend component, s(t) captures seasonal patterns, h(t) accounts for holiday effects, and Îµ_t represents the error term.

#### 3.2.2 Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and outputs the average prediction [14]. For regression tasks, the prediction is computed as:

Å· = (1/B) Î£ T_b(x)

where B is the number of trees and T_b(x) represents the prediction of the b-th tree.

#### 3.2.3 Ridge Regression
Ridge Regression applies L2 regularization to linear regression, minimizing the following objective function [15]:

min ||XÎ² - y||Â² + Î»||Î²||Â²

where Î» is the regularization parameter controlling model complexity.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Performance Analysis

The stark contrast between cross-validation and temporal validation results underscores the importance of appropriate evaluation methodologies for time series forecasting problems. Traditional cross-validation techniques may not adequately capture the temporal dependencies inherent in biogas production processes, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates [16][17].

Ridge Regression's superior cross-validation performance can be attributed to its ability to fit complex relationships in the training data through regularization. However, its poor temporal generalization suggests that the learned patterns may not capture the underlying temporal dynamics of biogas production. This finding aligns with previous research indicating that linear models may struggle with the complex, time-dependent nature of anaerobic digestion processes [18][19].

Random Forest's intermediate performance in both validation scenarios reflects its ensemble nature, which provides some protection against overfitting while maintaining reasonable predictive capability. However, the significant performance degradation in temporal validation indicates limitations in capturing long-term temporal patterns.

Prophet's design specifically for time series forecasting explains its better temporal generalization despite lower cross-validation scores. The model's explicit handling of trend and seasonality components makes it more suitable for biogas production prediction, where temporal patterns are crucial [20].

### 4.2 Practical Implications

For operational biogas prediction systems, these results suggest that model selection should prioritize temporal validation performance over cross-validation metrics. Prophet's better temporal generalization makes it more suitable for real-time biogas production forecasting, despite its lower cross-validation accuracy.

The poor temporal performance of Ridge Regression and Random Forest highlights the need for specialized time series approaches in biogas prediction applications. These findings support the adoption of time series-specific methodologies rather than general machine learning algorithms for operational forecasting systems.
